<h2>THE FIRST ACT</h2>


<p><i>The scene represents a manicure establishment in New
Bond Street. It is a front room upon the first
floor, with three french-windows affording a view
of certain buildings on the east side of the street.
On the left, furthest from the spectator, is a wide,
arched opening, apparently leading to another
apartment, in which is the door giving entrance to
the rooms from the staircase. Nearer, there is
another french-window, opening on to an expanse
of "leads" and showing the exterior of the wall
of the further room above-mentioned. From the
right, above the middle window, runs an ornamental
partition, about nine feet in height, with panels
of opaque glass. This partition extends more than
half-way across the room, then runs forward for
some distance, turns off at a sharp angle, and terminates
between the arched opening and the window
on the left. That part of the partition running
from right to left is closed on its left side and
forms, therefore, a separate room or compartment.
Facing the audience, on the right, is a door admitting
to this compartment; and, on the left, also in
the, partition opposite the windows on the right, is
<a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a>an opening with a looped-back porti&egrave;re. The space
between this opening and the further room forms a
narrow anteroom, containing articles of furniture
visible through the opening. Mirrors are affixed
to the right wall, between the lower and the middle
window and between the middle window and the
partition, while on the left, between the window and
the partition, is another mirror. A number of
business cards are stuck in the frames of the mirrors.
On the right, before each of the two lower windows,
turned from the spectator, is a capacious arm-chair,
made in cane open-work. Attached to the
arms of these chairs are little screens&mdash;also made
of cane&mdash;shielding in a measure the occupants
of the chairs from observation. Upon both the
right and left arms of these chairs are circular
frames, in cane, shaped to receive bowls of water
Above each of the screen-chairs stands a smaller
chair, set to face the larger one; and beside the
small chair, on its right hand, is a low table, upon
which are arranged the instruments and toilet
necessaries employed in the process of manicure
On the right, between the window and the partition
is a three-cornered what-not, on which are set out
packets of soap and of powder and other articles of
the toilet. At the further end of the room, in the
centre, stands a desk laden with account-books; and
above the desk, its back against the partition, is a
chair. On the right is a hat-and-umbrella stand.
Nearer, in the centre, is a large circular table on
which are displayed bottles of scent and liquid
soap, cases of instruments for manicure, and some
wooden bowls of bath-soap with lather brushes.
On the right and left are ordinary chairs. Placed
<a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a>against the partition on the left, and facing the
audience, is a cabinet, making a display similar to
that upon the what-not. Nearer, on the left, there
is another screen-chair set to face the audience;
below it is a smaller seat and, by the side of the
smaller seat, another little table with manicure
tools, &amp;c. Some framed photographs of ladies hang
against the wood-work of the partition and in the
wall-spaces; and in the lower and middle windows,
on the right, bird-cages are suspended.</i></p>

<p><i>The light is that of a bright day in June.</i></p>

<p class="right">[<i>On the right</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Claridge</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Miss
Huddle</span> <i>are in the final stages of manicuring
two smart-looking men. The men
occupy the screen-chairs; the manicurists&mdash;comely
girls in black frocks&mdash;sit, facing
the men, upon the smaller seats. On the
left</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Moon</span> <i>is rougeing and varnishing
the nails of a fashionably-dressed
young lady, whose maid is seated at the
table in the centre.</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Limbird</span> <i>is at
the desk, deep in accounts.</i></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Miss Moon</span>.</p>

<p>[<i>To the young lady.</i>] You won't have them <i>too</i> red,
will you?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Young Lady</span>.</p>

<p>Not too red&mdash;nicely flushed.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">First Gentleman</span>.</p>

<p>[<i>Examining his nails critically as he rises.</i>] I say
though, that's a vast improvement!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a>Miss Claridge</span>.</p>

<p>Getting more shapely, aren't they?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">First Gentleman</span>.</p>

<p>Thanks awfully.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>He pays</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Limbird</span>, <i>stands talking to her
for a while, and ultimately strolls away
through the opening in the partition.

Claridge</span> <i>goes out the same way, carrying
her bowl of water and towel</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Miss Moon</span>.</p>

<p>[<i>To the young lady.</i>] Have you had your hand read
yet, madam, by any of these palmists?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Young Lady</span>.</p>

<p>Heavens, yes! I've been twice to that woman
Bernstein, and I don't know how often to Chiron.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Miss Moon</span>.</p>

<p>Ah, you ought to try Valma.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Young Lady</span>.</p>

<p>Valma?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Miss Moon</span>.</p>

<p>He's the latest. Ladies are flocking to him.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Young Lady</span>.</p>

<p>Really?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a>Miss Moon</span>.</p>

<p>Yes. Such taking manners.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Young Lady</span>.</p>

<p>Where does he&mdash;?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Miss Moon</span>.</p>

<p>186&mdash;next door. [<i>Indicating the window on the
left.</i>] You can see his waiting-room from that window.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Young Lady</span>.</p>

<p>Is he a guinea or half a guinea?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Miss Moon</span>.</p>

<p>Oh, he's a guinea.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Young Lady</span>.</p>

<p>That's a bore.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Miss Moon</span>.</p>

<p>Ah, but consider, madam&mdash;his rooms are draped
from ceiling to floor in blue velvet. Blue velvet!
fancy! Not that I've had the privilege of viewing
them myself; Miss F. is our authority.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Young Lady</span>.</p>

<p>Miss F.?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Miss Moon</span>.</p>

<p>I beg your pardon&mdash;Miss Fullgarney. Valma is
quite neighbourly with Miss Fullgarney.</p>

that.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>.</p>

<p>[<i>After a cautious glance round.</i>] You know, Mr.
Valma, I was always a self-willed, independent sort
<a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>of a girl&mdash;a handful, they used to call me; and when
father died I determined to have done with my step-mother,
and to come to London at any price. I was
seventeen then.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pollitt</span>.</p>

<p>Yes?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>.</p>

<p>Oh, it's nothing to be ashamed of, really; still, I
did begin life in town&mdash;[<i>with an uneasy little laugh
and a toss of the head</i>]&mdash;you'd hardly believe it!&mdash;as a
nursery-maid.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pollitt</span>.</p>

<p>H'm! I am aware that is not considered&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>.</p>

<p>I should think not! Oh, of course, in time I rose
to be Useful Maid, and then Maid. I've been lady's-maid
in some excellent houses. And when I got sick
of maiding I went to Dundas's opposite, and served
three years at the hairdressing; that's an extremely
refined position, I needn't say. And then some kind
friends routed me out, [<i>surveying the room proudly</i>]
and put me into this.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pollitt</span>.</p>

<p>Then why bestow a second thought upon your
beginnings?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>.</p>

<p>No, I suppose I oughtn't to. Nobody can breathe
a word against my respectability. All the same, I
am quite aware that it mightn't be over pleasant for
<a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>a gentleman to remember that his wife was once&mdash;[<i>sitting
in the screen-chair</i>] well, a servant.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pollitt</span>.</p>

<p>[<i>By her chair.</i>] It would not weigh on my mind if
you had been kitchen-maid [<i>pointing out of the window</i>]
at Fletcher's Hotel. [<i>Looking about him.</i>] It's
this business I don't care for.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>.</p>

<p>This business!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pollitt</span>.</p>

<p>For <i>you</i>. If you did no more than glide about
your rooms, superintending your young ladies!
[<i>Sitting, facing her.</i>] But I hate the idea of your
sitting here, or there, holding some man's hand in
yours!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>.</p>

<p>[<i>Suddenly ablaze.</i>] Do you! [<i>Pointing out of the
window.</i>] Yet you sit there, day after day, and hold
women's hands in yours!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pollitt</span>.</p>

<p>[<i>Eagerly.</i>] You are jealous of me?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>Sophy</span>.</p>

<p>[<i>Faintly.</i>] Fondly.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pollitt</span>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pollitt</span>.</p>

<p>What?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>.</p>

<p>That you were not so much my superior in every

Julia. You remember Lady Owbridge?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Frayne</span>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Quex</span>.</p>

<p>There <i>were</i> flowers.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Frayne</span>.</p>

<p>I know&mdash;<i>I</i> know! Nearly twenty years ago, and
the faint scent of the <i>Gardenia Florida</i> remains in my
nostrils!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>Quex</span>.</p>

<p>Quite so. Would <i>you</i> like to&mdash;?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Quex</span>.</p>

<p>[<i>Sitting on the edge of the table, looking down upon</i>
<span class="smcap">Frayne</span>.] When I proposed to Miss Eden I was certain&mdash;even
while I was stammering it out&mdash;I was
certain that my infernal evil character&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Frayne</span>.</p>

<p>Ah, yes. I've always been a dooced deal more artful
than you, Harry, over my little <i>amours</i>. [<i>Chuckling.</i>]
Ha, ha! devilish cunning!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Quex</span>.</p>

<p>And I was right. Her first words were, "Think
of your life; how can you ask this of me?"&mdash;her first
words and her last, that evening. I was desperate,
Chick, for I&mdash; Well, I'm hit, you know.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Frayne</span>.</p>

<p>What did you do?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Quex</span>.</p>

<p>Came to town by the first train in the morning&mdash;drove
straight off to Richmond, to my pious aunt.
Found her in bed with asthma; <i>I</i> got her up. And
I almost went down on my knees to her, Chick.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>Frayne</span>.</p>

<p>Not really?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Quex</span>.</p>

<p>I did&mdash;old man as I am! no, I'm not old.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Frayne</span>.</p>

<p>Forty-eight. Ha, ha! I'm only forty-five.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Quex</span>.</p>

<p>But you've had malaria&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Frayne</span>.</p>

<p>Dry up, Harry!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Quex</span>.</p>

<p>So we're quits. Well, down on my marrow-bones I
went, metaphorically, and there and then I made my
vows to old aunt Julia, and craved her help; and she
dropped tears on me, Chick, like a mother. And the
result was that within a month I became engaged to
Miss Eden.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Frayne</span>.</p>

<p>The young lady soon waived her&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Quex</span>.</p>

<p>[<i>Getting off the table.</i>] I beg your pardon&mdash;the
young lady did nothing of the kind. But with aunt
Julia's aid I showed 'em all that it was a genuine case
of done with the old life&mdash;a real, genuine instance.
[<i>Balancing upon the back of the chair.</i>] I've sold my
house in Norfolk Street.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>Frayne</span>.</p>

<p>You'll want one.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Quex</span>.</p>

<p>[<i>Gravely.</i>] Not that one&mdash;for Muriel. [<i>Brightly.</i>]
And I'm living sedately at Richmond, under aunt
Julia's wing. Muriel is staying at Fauncey Court too,
just now; she's up from Norfolk for the Season,
chaperoned by Mrs. Jack. [<i>Sitting, nursing his knee,

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Quex</span>.</p>

<p>[<i>Rising.</i>] No; I who always laughed at marriage as
a dull depravity permitted to the respectable classes!
I who always maintained that man's whole duty to
woman&mdash;meaning his mistresses&mdash;that a man's duty
to a woman is liberally discharged when he has made
a settlement on her, or stuck her into his will!

<p><i>The scene represents a portion of an English garden
laid out in Italian fashion. At the extreme back&mdash;upon
ground slightly raised&mdash;two dense cypress-hedges,
about sixteen feet high, form an alley running
from right to left. In the centre of the hedge
which is nearer the spectator there is an opening,
and at this opening are three or four steps connecting
the higher with the lower level. Beyond the
alley nothing is seen but the sky and some tree-tops.
In advance is an enclosure formed by a
dwarf cypress-hedge, about four feet in height,
also broken in the centre by an opening, and running
off right and left at a sharp angle. On the
outside of the dwarf hedge is a walk; and beyond,
on the right and left, are trees. Within the enclosure,
on the left, is a small fountain; facing the
fountain, on the right, a piece of old, broken
sculpture. Other bits of antique sculpture are
placed in different parts of the garden. In the
foreground, on the right towards the centre, stands
a stone bench, on the left of which is a table upon
which are the remains of "afternoon tea," with a
garden chair. A similar stone bench stands
opposite.</i></p>

<p><i>The light is that of a very fine evening.</i></p>

<p class="right"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>[<span class="smcap">Lady Owbridge</span> <i>is in the garden-chair,
asleep, an open book in her lap.</i> <span class="smcap">Quex</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Muriel</span> <i>stand, talking together, by
the fountain. On the right-hand stone
bench the</i> <span class="smcap">Duchess of Strood</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Eden</span> <i>are seated. The</i> <span class="smcap">Duchess</span> <i>is a
daintily beautiful doll of about seven-and-thirty&mdash;a</i>
poseuse, <i>outwardly dignified
and stately when upon her guard,
really a frail, shallow little creature full
of extravagant sentimentality. Until</i>
<span class="smcap">Lady Owbridge</span> <i>wakes, the conversation
is carried on in subdued tones.</i></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Eden</span>.</p>

<p>[<i>Indicating</i> <span class="smcap">Muriel</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Quex</span>.] They make a

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Duchess</span>.</p>

<p>[<i>With placid melancholy.</i>] To see two people on the
threshold of wedlock is always painfully interesting.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Eden</span>.</p>

<p>I am quite triumphant about it. It is such a
delightful engagement, now that the horrid difficulties
are smoothed away.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Duchess</span>.</p>

<p>Yes, you were telling me of some sad obstacles&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Eden</span>.</p>

<p>I nearly perished of them! [<i>Very confidentially.</i>]<a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>

exceptionally naughty.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Duchess</span>.</p>

<p>Really? Ah! don't be surprised that I am not
more deeply shocked. In these surroundings it is
hard to realise that every aspect of life is not as lovely
as&mdash;[<i>pointing to the foliage</i>] the tones of those exquisite,
deep greens, for example.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Eden</span>.</p>

<p>However, the dear thing is going to be <i>so</i> good in
the future. [<i>Turning to the</i> <span class="smcap">Duchess</span>.] I keep forgetting&mdash;Lord

<p>I am inclined to agree with you, sir.</p>

<p>Fortunately I have been able to dress quickly without
exciting curiosity. My maid was summoned
<a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a>away this afternoon, to her father who is sick. [<i>Sinking

enough.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Quex</span>.</p>

<p>And yet you deliberately court them!</p>

whom you are about to <i>ranger</i> yourself, Harry.</p>

<p>Even that could have been arrived at in some safer

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Duchess</span>.</p>

<p>Ah, but you fail to see; it was the daring of this
proceeding that attracted me&mdash;the romance of it!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Quex</span>.</p>

<p>[<i>Raising his hands.</i>] Romance! still!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Duchess</span>.</p>

<p>You ought, you really ought, to have flourished in

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Duchess</span>.</p>

<p>You have frequently made that observation.
[<i>Rising.</i>] I do live in the Middle Ages, in my imagination.
I live in every age in which Love was not
a cool, level emotion, but a fierce, all-conquering
flame&mdash;a flame that grew in the heart of a woman,
that of a sudden spread through her whole organism,
that lit up her eyes with a light more refulgent than
the light of sun or moon! [<i>Laying her hand upon
his arm.</i>] Oh, oh, this poor, thin, modern sentiment
miscalled Love&mdash;!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Quex</span>.</p>

<p>[<i>Edging away.</i>] Sssh! pray be careful!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Duchess</span>.</p>

<p>Ah, yes. But, dear Harry, I cannot endure the
ordeal any longer.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Quex</span>.</p>

<p>The ordeal?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Duchess</span>.</p>

<p>The prolonged discomfort, to which I have subjected
myself, of watching your wooing of Miss Eden.

your wild, irregular career to a close; but after to-<a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>morrow

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Duchess</span>.</p>

sun! Could any situation be more appropriate?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Duchess</span>.</p>

<p>But we are liable to be interrupted at any moment.
The joint romance of our lives, Harry, ought not to
end with a curt word and formal hand-shake in an
exposed spot of this kind. [<i>Sitting in the garden

<p>Second reason?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>Duchess</span>.</p>

<p>[<i>Intensely, in a low voice.</i>] Harry, do you remember
a particular evening at Stockholm?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Quex</span>.</p>

<p>[<i>Hazily.</i>] Stockholm?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Duchess</span>.</p>

<p>That evening upon which we discovered how much
our society meant to each other!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Quex</span>.</p>

<p>[<i>Vaguely, while he hastily recovers possession of his
hand.</i>] At Stockholm was it&mdash;?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Duchess</span>.</p>

<p>You were sailing with us in the Baltic&mdash;you must
recollect? Our yacht had put in at Stockholm; we
had come to the Grand Hotel. Strood had retired,
and you and I were sitting out upon the balcony
watching the lights of the caf&eacute; on the Norrbro and
the tiny steamboats that stole to and fro across the
harbour. Surely you recollect?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Quex</span>.</p>

<p>Yes, yes, of course.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Duchess</span>.</p>

<p>Well, do you remember the brand of the champagne
you sipped while you and I sat smoking?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Quex</span>.</p>

<p>Good lord, no!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>Duchess</span>.</p>

<p>"F&eacute;lix Poubelle, Carte d'Or." You remarked that
it was a brand unknown to you. Have you ever met
it since, Harry?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Quex</span>.</p>

<p>Not that I&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Duchess</span>.</p>

<p>Nor I till last night, at dinner. [<i>Impressively.</i>] It is
in this very house.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Quex</span>.</p>

<p>[<i>With a slight shrug of the shoulders.</i>] Extremely
probable.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Duchess</span>.</p>

<p>And do you remember how I was clad, that evening
at Stockholm?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Quex</span>.</p>

<p>I am afraid I don't.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Duchess</span>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Duchess</span>.</p>

<p>No, no&mdash;only the words, "warm evening." Yes, it
was upon a Wednesday. What is to-day?</p>

In the first shock of the news of your engagement&mdash;for
it was a shock&mdash;one thought consoled me;
throughout the time that has elapsed since then I
have fed upon this same thought&mdash;there will be a

now, you would rob me even of that!</p>

<p>Not by me, Harry&mdash;not by me. I wish to carry,

piteous climax. I cannot drive away smugly from
these gates with the simple feelings of a woman who

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Muriel</span>.</p>

<p>Why do you ask?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>.</p>

<p>I've just seen them together, talking.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Muriel</span>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Muriel</span>.</p>

<p>How?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>.</p>

<p>I'll tell you. After you went indoors to dress, I
took off my rings and put them on that table. [<i>Looking
away rather guiltily.</i>] Rings fidget me, this hot
weather&mdash;don't they you? Well, just as I'd finished
with Mrs. Jack, it suddenly struck me&mdash;my rings!&mdash;and
I hurried back to fetch them. When I got here,
I came across Lord Quex and the Duchess.</p>

<p>[<i>Calmly.</i>] Yes?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>.</p>

<p>I stooped down behind that hedge there.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Muriel</span>.</p>

<p>You did not!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>.</p>

<p>Oh, I suppose you consider it mean!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Muriel</span>.</p>

<p>Despicable!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>.</p>

<p>Despicable, is it! I don't care! My goodness, I'd
do the shabbiest thing a woman could do to save you
from him!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Muriel</span>.</p>

<p>[<i>Peering among the trees.</i>] Hush, hush, hush!</p>

each other. [<span class="smcap">Muriel</span> <i>changes her position.</i>] I saw
her touch his arm. Oh, I'm positive there's something
between those two! "You will?" I heard her
say. And then he made a remark about Friday&mdash;Friday&mdash;</p>

<p>The Duchess goes on Friday.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>.</p>

<p>That was it, of course! And then she mumbled
something I couldn't catch; and then&mdash;listen to this!&mdash;then
she said "to-night," quite plainly. <i>To-night!</i>
and in such a tone of voice! And then he bowed,
and out she came with "to-night" again&mdash;"to-night,"
for the second time&mdash;and away she went. Now, what
do you think that "to-night" of hers means?</p>

<p><i>The scene represents two rooms&mdash;a bedroom and a
boudoir&mdash;separated by an arched opening across
which a porti&egrave;re is hung. The porti&egrave;re is, however,
drawn aside, and the bedroom, in which is a
bed with an elaborate canopy, is partly revealed.
The boudoir is nearest to the spectator. Above
the fireplace, with bare hearth, on the right, is
a broad window running obliquely towards the
centre, concealed by heavy curtains. On the left
of the window, facing the audience, is a door admitting
to a long, narrow passage in which a
hanging lamp is burning; and on the left of this
door is the arched opening dividing the bedroom
from the boudoir. Another door opens into the
boudoir on the opposite side from a corridor or
landing. Beyond this door, against the wall, is a
cabinet, on the top of which is a clock. A chair
stands at each end of this cabinet. On the left of
the arched opening&mdash;placed obliquely, the mirror
turned from the audience&mdash;is a cheval-glass; and
on the right is a sculptured figure or ornamental
pillar supporting a lighted lamp. Before the
window stands a large dressing-table. On the
table are a pair of candelabra with lighted candles,
a looking-glass, toilet-bottles, and a hand-mirror.<a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>
A chair faces the dressing-table. Nearer to the
spectator are a writing-table, with a heap of French
novels on it, and an arm-chair. Opposite stand a
circular table, an arm-chair, and a settee. A silver
box containing cigarettes, an ash-tray, a match-stand,
and a lighted spirit-lamp are on this table.</i></p>

<p><i>The rooms are richly furnished and decorated,
but in an old-fashioned and formal manner.
Everything is subdued and faded in tone. There
are no pillows upon the chairs, nor on the settee,
nor any other signs of ease and comfort. Keys
are in the locks of both the doors.</i></p>

<p>That!</p>

<p>But a headache&mdash;[<i>sympathetically</i>] dear child!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Eden</span>.</p>

<p>An engaged girl ought not to have a headache&mdash;no

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Duchess</span>.</p>

<p>Ponder?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Eden</span>.</p>

<p>Reflect. A man loves to think a girl is like an
angel&mdash;beautiful pink and white right through, with
no clockwork. The moment she complains of headache,
or toothache, or a chilblain on the heel, the
angel game is off, and she's got to try and hold her
own as a simple mortal. And as a mortal she's not
in it with a man. No, it's angel or nothing with us
women. I remember my Mater saying to me when
I was engaged to Jack, "Sybil, now mind! enjoy the
very best of health till you have been married at least
ten years; and then be sure you have an excellent
motive for cracking-up." [<i>The clock tinkles out the

<p>[<i>Going to the writing-table and taking up a book.</i>]
No. I will do it. The exertion of brushing my hair,
I often find, encourages sleep. I'll put myself to bed.
Run away. Don't let me see or hear anything of you
till the morning. Eight o'clock. [<i>She reclines upon

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>.</p>

<p>Believe in him, your Grace?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>Duchess</span>.</p>

<p>Believe that when he reads a woman's hand he
has really the power of divination&mdash;the power he
professes?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>.</p>

<p>Oh, yes.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Duchess</span>.</p>

<p>[<i>Looking away.</i>] Then if he tells a woman that a
great many men are deeply in love with her, you&mdash;you&mdash;?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>.</p>

<p>I'm sure he knows what he's talking about.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Duchess</span>.</p>

<p>[<i>With a little purr of contentment.</i>] Ah! [<i>Assuming
indifference.</i>] I heard recently of an instance of
his having conjectured such a state of affairs from the
lines of a woman's hand. [<i>Severely.</i>] I could only
hope that his surmise was an incorrect one.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>.</p>

<p>[<i>Her eyes flashing scornfully.</i>] You see, your Grace,
if a woman is pretty, and Valma finds Venus's girdle
well marked in her palm; and if he concludes from
other signs that she's vain and light and loose; it
isn't much to suppose that there are a few horrid men
licking their lips at the thought of her.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Duchess</span>.</p>

<p>[<i>Raising her head for a moment.</i>] Good-night. You

<p>Yes, you have thanked me enough. Turn out the

<p>Certainly, your Grace.</p>

<p class="right">[<span class="smcap">Sophy</span> <i>disappears, shutting the door after
her. The</i> <span class="smcap">Duchess</span> <i>remains quite still for
a moment, then rises promptly, replaces

her hair in order. This
done, she takes up the hand-mirror and
smiles, frowns, and looks caressingly at
herself. Then she lays the hand-mirror
aside, blows out the candles upon the
dressing-table, and poses before the cheval-glass.
Ultimately, completely assured as
to her appearance, she cautiously opens the
door at which</i> <span class="smcap">Sophy</span> <i>has departed, and,
going a few steps along the passage, listens

gently, turns the key in the lock. Her
next proceeding is to attempt to tear one of
the ribbons from her tea-gown. Failing
in this, she detaches it with the aid of a
pair of scissors, and, opening the door
leading from the corridor, ties the ribbon
to the outer door-handle. Whereupon she
closes the door and walks about the room
contentedly. Suddenly she pauses, and,
going to the cabinet, produces a small tray
on which are a bottle of champagne and a
champagne glass. Placing the tray on
the circular table, she regards the single
glass thoughtfully. Then, as if struck by
an idea, she disappears into the bedroom.
After a brief interval, the door opens softly
and</i> <span class="smcap">Quex</span> <i>enters, carrying a lighted wax
match. Being in, he shuts the door
silently and looks about the room. Hearing
the</i> <span class="smcap">Duchess</span> <i>in the adjoining apartment,
he frowns and blows out the match.
Coming to the circular table, he contemplates
the preparation for his reception
with distaste; then, flinging the match
into the ash-tray, he sits, with a set,
determined look upon his face. After
another short pause, the</i> <span class="smcap">Duchess</span> <i>returns,

<p>Yes, yes. Only don't raise your voice; [<i>glancing

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Quex</span>.</p>

<p>[<i>Bitterly, withdrawing the chair a little further from

<p>Forgive me&mdash;you admit that you delight in colouring
even the most ordinary events of life rather
highly. If I may put it more roughly, you are
disposed, my dear Sidonia&mdash;at times, perhaps, a little
inopportunely&mdash;to burn a good deal of red fire. [<i>Leaning

<p>Yes. [<i>Clenching his teeth.</i>] And this is how I

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Duchess</span>.</p>

holds it up to him in explanation; he
nods, and she lets herself out. He
immediately locks the door at which she
has departed and slips the key into his
waistcoat pocket. This done, he pulls the
bell-rope communicating with the maid's
room and takes up a position against the
wall so that the opening of the passage

you haven't reckoned for, I can assure you. Here's
one&mdash;I told Miss Muriel exactly what I heard,
between you and your Duchess, in the garden this
evening.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Quex</span>.</p>

<p>[<i>Recovering himself.</i>] Oh, you did, did you?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>.</p>

<p>[<i>Facing him defiantly.</i>] Yes, I did.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Quex</span>.</p>

<p>[<i>Coolly.</i>] Well? and what then? You listen to a
conversation carried on in an open spot, from which
your mischievous ears manage to detach the phrase
"to-night." My explanation, if I am called upon to
make one, will be absurdly simple.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a>Sophy</span>.</p>

<p>[<i>Derisively.</i>] Ha, ha! will it! ha, ha, ha! I daresay!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Quex</span>.</p>

<p>Yes. You see, I promised her Grace that I would
send a book to her room to-night&mdash;<i>to-night</i>. My man
had gone to bed; I brought it myself, intending to
hand it to Mrs. Watson, her maid. In the meantime,
the Duchess had joined Mrs. Eden and I found
<i>you</i> here.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>.</p>

<p>You couldn't tell such an abominable lie!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Quex</span>.</p>

<p>[<i>Imperturbably.</i>] I found <i>you</i> here. And then&mdash;what
is the obvious sequel to the story? [<i>Shrugging
his shoulders.</i>] I'm a wicked man, Sophy, and you're
an undeniably pretty girl&mdash;and the devil dared me.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>.</p>

<p>Oh&mdash;!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Quex</span>.</p>

<p>[<i>Taking up the bottle of champagne.</i>] And an excellent
banquet you had chanced to provide for the
occasion. [<i>Reading the label.</i>] "F&eacute;lix Poubelle, Carte
d'Or." It will appear, I am afraid, that you had
been preparing for the entertainment of some amorous
footman.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>.</p>

<p>[<i>Snapping her fingers at him.</i>] Puh! bah! Oh, the

champagne.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Quex</span>.</p>

that tale. You wheedled this out of him on your own

<p>[<i>Disconcerted.</i>] Oh&mdash;ah, yes&mdash;but&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Quex</span>.</p>

carry her devotion to this extent. Good heavens!

was a blackguard till I met Miss Eden; and now,
losing Miss Eden, perhaps I'm going to be a bigger
blackguard than before. At the same time, you
know, there's not much to choose between us; for
you're a low spy, an impudent, bare-faced liar, a
common kitchen-cat who wriggles into the best rooms,

<p>The lady beamed upon me, for all the world as if
she was an angel spending a Saturday-to-Monday
here below; and I dressed her hair for her just as if
I didn't want to tear it out by the roots. And then
she turned up her eyes and said she hoped every
happiness would attend me, and went downstairs to
prayers.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Quex</span>.</p>

<p>Will you allow me to&mdash;to thank you?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>.</p>

<p>[<i>Frigidly.</i>] You needn't. [<i>Abruptly.</i>] Oh, by-the-by,

it. [<i>Endeavouring to extract some bulky object from

found out what's inside it. But I can't get it open.
Here it is.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>She exhibits the little box, covered with

<p>No; not since last evening.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>.</p>

<p>Quite so. And&mdash;and then&mdash;?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sophy</span>.</p>

<p>[<i>Facing him candidly.</i>] Your lordship told me last
night that your little visit to the Duchess was a
perfectly innocent one?</p>

<p>[<i>Fanning himself with his handkerchief.</i>] By gad,
why not, Harry? We are in Miss Fullgarney's hands.
[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Sophy</span>.] His lordship went to her Grace's apartment

you'd kindly go away and call again a little later.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
